            <h3 class="mt-5">Location:</h3>
            <p class="lead text-justify mx-5">Russian Hill is directly to the north (and slightly downhill) from Nob
                Hill,to the south (uphill) from
                Fisherman's Wharf, and to the west of the North Beach neighborhood. The Hill is bordered on its west
                side by
                parts of the neighborhoods of Cow Hollow and the Marina District.
                At the northern foot of the hill is Ghirardelli Square, which sits on the waterfront of the San
                Francisco
                Bay, Aquatic Park, and Fisherman's Wharf, an extremely popular tourist area. A trip down the winding
                turns
                of Lombard Street and across Columbus Avenue to the east leads to the neighborhood of North Beach.
                Down
                the
                hill to the west, past Van Ness Avenue, are Cow Hollow and the Marina districts.</p>
            <h3>History:</h3>
            <p class="lead text-justify mx-5">The neighborhood's name goes back to the Gold Rush era, when settlers
                discovered a small Russian cemetery at the top of the hill. Russian naval and merchant ships
                frequently
                visited San Francisco throughout the 19th century beginning in 1806, and there are several mentions
                of
                burials of crew members in the Russian Hill cemetery in the first half of the century. The cemetery
                was
                eventually removed, but the name remained.</p>
            <h3>Noteworthy characteristics:</h3>
            <p class="lead text-justify mx-5">The neighborhood is most famous for Lombard Street, the one-way
                section
                on Russian Hill between Hyde and Leavenworth Streets, in which the roadway has eight sharp turns (or
                switchbacks) that have earned the street the distinction of being "the crookedest street in the
                world".
                The switchbacks design, first suggested by property owner Carl Henry and built in 1922, was
                intended to reduce the hill's natural 27 percent grade, which was too steep for most vehicles to
                climb. As it is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the city, this section of the
                neighborhood
                is frequently crowded with tourists. Tourists also frequent the famous cable car line along Hyde
                Street,
                which is lined with many restaurants and shops.</p>
            <p class="lead text-justify mx-5">A small park at the top of the hill on Vallejo Street features a small
                plaque and memorial placed by the Russian Government that is dedicated to the original Russian
                cemetery
                that is the neighborhood's namesake. Another park is named after Ina Coolbrith.</p>
            <p class="lead text-justify mx-5">Views from the top of the hill extend in several directions around the
                Bay
                Area, including the Bay Bridge, Marin County, the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. Russian Hill is
                home
                to the San Francisco Art Institute, located on Chestnut Street between Jones and Leavenworth
                Streets.
                Academy of Art University also maintains a presence in this neighborhood with their Chestnut St.
                building hosting their fine art MFA studios, photo classrooms, and photo studios</p>
            <p class="lead text-justify mx-5">Because of the steepness of the hill, many streets, portions of
                Vallejo
                and Green streets, for example, are staircases. Another famous feature of Russian Hill are the many
                pedestrian-only lanes such as Macondray Lane and Fallon Place, both with beautiful landscaping and
                arresting views.</p>
            <p class="lead text-justify mx-5">Alice Marble Tennis Courts are four hardcourt tennis courts located at
                Lombard and Hyde Streets. The courts offer a view of the bay and North Beach and can be unsuitable
                for
                tennis on windy days. A basketball court is located adjacent to the tennis courts. The San Francisco
                Cable Cars serving the Powell-Hyde line stops nearby.</p>
